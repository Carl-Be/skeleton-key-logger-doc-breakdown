THP3 Skeleton key logger documentation dreakdown.  

Though I have done some  low level \*Unix programming (C and NASM) i've yet to explore the widows enviroment until now. 
While re-reading THP3 i've stumbled accross a key logger program for windows machines that give me a good opertunity 
to see the capabilities of windows programming. Here is a breakdown of the all the documentation that goes into making 
a skeleton key-logger program for current windows machines.
